## Arabic Word Embedding Models

This repository provides Arabic word embedding models designed to enhance Arabic natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The models achieved exceptional results, including 90% accuracy on analogy tests, 99% accuracy on sentiment analysis tasks, and a similarity score of 8.1/10. These embeddings are ideal for researchers and developers working with Arabic NLP.
